				<p><strong>African elephants </strong>are elephants of the genus Loxodonta,[2] from Greek λοξός (loxós 'slanting, crosswise, oblique sided') + ὀδούς (odoús, stem odónt-, 'tooth'). The genus consists of two extant species: the African bush elephant, L. africana, and the smaller African forest elephant, L. cyclotis. Loxodonta is one of two existing genera of the family, Elephantidae.[1] Fossil remains of Loxodonta have been found only in Africa, in strata as old as the middle Pliocene. However, sequence analysis of DNA extracted from fossils of an extinct elephant species undermines the validity of the genus.[3]</p>

					<h2 class="slide-head">Habitat</h2>
					<p>Bush and forest elephants were formerly considered subspecies[12] of Loxodonta africana. As described in the entry for the forest elephant in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World (MSW3),[13] there is morphological and genetic evidence that they should be considered as separate species.</p>

					<p>Protection of African elephants is a high-profile conservation cause in many countries. In 1989, the Kenyan Wildlife Service burned a stockpile of tusks in protest against the ivory trade.[53] However, African elephant populations can be devastated by poaching despite nominal governmental protection,[54] and some nations permit the hunting of elephants for sport.[6] In 2012</p>

					<p>Moeritherium ('the beast from Lake Moeris') standing only 70 centimetres (2.3 ft) high at the shoulder and weighing 235 kilograms (518 lb). The shape of their teeth suggests that they ate soft water vegetation. They did not have an elephant-like trunk, may have had a broad flexible upper lip like a tapir's for grasping aquatic vegetation. The second incisor teeth formed small tusks, although these would have looked more like the teeth of a hippo than a modern elephant.</p>

					<p>Amebelodon (the so-called shovel-tusker) Amebelodon had two pairs of tusks,‭ ‬one in the upper jaw and one pair in the lower.‭ ‬The lower pair of tusks are of particular interest with this genus since they were shaped to form a shovel-like structure that pointed forwards from the lower jaw.‭ ‬It is widely believed that these tusks were feeding adaptations that allowed Amebelodon to uproot plants and scrape off tree bark.</p>

					<p>Deinotherium ("terrible beast"). The length of the body from different species ranged from 3.5-7 metres and weight was up 10 000 kg. It was perhaps one of the most biggest hairless elephants of all time. Resembled modern elephants, except that its trunk was shorter, and it had downward curving tusks attached to the lower jaw. The tusks were used to root in soil for underground plant parts, pull down branches to snap them and reach leaves, or strip soft bark from tree trunks.</p>

					<p>Gomphotherium ("Welded Beast") stood around 3 metres high with an estimated weight of 4-5 tons. It had four tusks, two on the upper jaw and two on the elongated lower jaw. The lower tusks are parallel and shaped like a shovel and were probably used for digging up food from mud. Unlike modern elephants, the upper tusks were covered by a layer of enamel. These animals had a short trunk, rather like a tapir's. Probably lived in swamps or near lakes, using their tusks to dig or scrape up aquatic vegetation</p>

					<p>Stegotetrabelodon  measured roughly 3 to 4 metres high at the shoulder. This genus is the first example of elephant herd activity. It had four tusks - two in the top jaw and two in the bottom - and seems to have been larger than modern elephants, judging from the track measurements</p>

					<p>Stegodon species were among the largest of all Proboscidea, with adults being 4 m high at the shoulder, 8 m long, not including 3 m long nearly straight tusks. In some individuals, the tusks were so close together that the trunk probably did not lie between them but instead draped over. Stegodon floresiensis was very much smaller, estimated to weigh about 300 kilograms. They have undergone island dwarfism in Indonesia due to small area and fewer resources. Remains bearing cut marks have been found suggesting that the dwarf Stegodon was prey for the humans.</p>

					<p>Mastodon ("Nipple Tooth"). Mastodons were famous for their long, curved, dangerous-looking tusks probably evolved as a sexually selected characteristic, as five-ton male Mastodons battled one another for the right to mate with available females. They had thick coats of shaggy hair, to protect them from the intense cold of Pleistocene North America and Eurasia. Lived in herds and were predominantly forest dwelling animals that fed on a mixed diet obtained by browsing and grazing with a seasonal preference for browsing, similar to living elephants.</p>

					<p>Mammuthus subplanifrons, or the South African mammoth, is the oldest representative of the genus Mammuthus, appearing  in what is today South Africa and countries of East Africa. They already presented some of the unique characteristics of mammoths like the spirally, twisting tusks. They were quite large where males may have exceeded 12 tonnes. Mammuthus primigenius is more popularly known as the woolly mammoth that today is regarded as the poster animal for the ice age. They had the long shaggy coat of hair over its body,‭ up to meter long, to provide the main insulation from the cold.  Another adaptation to the cold environments is the small size of the ears which are only thirty centimetres long at most. ‬The tusks of woolly mammoths are thought by many to have grown so long and curved so that they could sweep off the fresh covering of snow and get at the grass underneath. </p>

					<p>Elephas antiquus (the straight-tusked elephant). It was quite large reaching 4 metres (13.1 ft) in height and weight up to 12 tonnes. In 2016, DNA sequence analysis showed that its closest extant relative is the African forest elephant. It had long, slightly upward-curving tusks. It legs were slightly longer than those of modern elephants. This elephant is thought to have had an 80-cm-long tongue that could be projected a short distance from the mouth to grasp leaves and grasses. With this tongue and a flexible trunk, straight-tusked elephants could graze or browse on Pleistocene foliage about 8 m above ground.  It became extinct in Britain by the beginning of the last glacial, about 115,000 years ago. Eventually it was replaced by the mammoth.</p>

					<p>African elephants are elephants of the genus Loxodonta. The genus consists of two extant species: the African bush elephant, L. africana, and the smaller African forest elephant, L. cyclotis. The bush elephant, is the largest living terrestrial animal. Their thickset bodies rest on stocky legs, and they have concave backs. Their large ears enable heat loss. The upper lip and nose form a trunk. The trunk acts as a fifth limb, a sound amplifier, and an important method of touch. African elephants' trunks end in two opposing lips. The elephants' tusks are firm teeth; the second set of incisors become the tusks. They are used for digging for roots and stripping the bark from trees for food; for fighting each other during mating season; and for defending themselves against predators. The tusks weigh from 23–45 kg (51–99 lb) and can be from 1.5–2.4 m (5–8 ft) long. They are curved forward and continue to grow throughout the elephant's lifetime. Elephants replace their teeth four to six times in their lifetime. At about 40 to 60 years of age, the elephant loses the last of its molars and will likely die of starvation, a common cause of death.</p>
